In this project, a machine learning-based approach was developed to predict the credit risk of loan applicants using the German Credit dataset. The objective was to classify applicants into two categories: good credit risk and bad credit risk. The dataset was first loaded and explored to understand feature distributions and detect any missing values, which were found to be absent. Data visualization was employed to study the relationship between credit risk and key features such as age, credit amount, and housing status. Categorical features were encoded using Label Encoding, and numerical features were standardized using StandardScaler to ensure models performed optimally. The data was split into training and testing sets in an 80-20 ratio. Four machine learning models—Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, XGBoost Classifier, and Support Vector Classifier—were trained and evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV was performed to optimize Random Forest and XGBoost models. Among the models, XGBoost Classifier achieved the highest performance with an accuracy of approximately 85%, and was therefore selected as the final model. Model interpretability was emphasized using SHAP values, which identified that features like credit amount, age, checking account balance, and loan duration were most influential in determining credit risk. The approach of experimenting with multiple models, careful preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, and the use of interpretable machine learning techniques was chosen to ensure a highly accurate, robust, and transparent credit risk prediction system. This workflow not only resulted in a strong predictive model but also provided valuable business insights for improving credit evaluation strategies.
